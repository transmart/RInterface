# Notes for first time installers:

# The package transmartRClient depends on these packages: httr, jsonlite, RProtoBuf, plyr, hash, reshape and XML.
# You can install them as follows:
install.packages(pkgs=c("httr", "jsonlite", "RProtoBuf", "plyr", "hash", "reshape", "XML"))

# RProtoBuf depends on the system protobuf headers. For Ubuntu you will need to
# install the libprotoc-dev and libprotobuf-dev packages.

# One nasty issue encountered in some MacOSX versions (at least in 10.9) is that
# the R version installed via homebrew runs into a libl library error. Please
# use the default R installed via the CRAN installer, which does not have this
# issue

# Now you can install the transmartRClient. First, point the following path to the location of your "transmartRClient"
# directory, which is the parent directory of the directory where this installCommands.R file is located
pathOfPackageSource <- "somePath/repository-location/RInterface"
# The following command will install the package from its source files into your standard library
install.packages(pathOfPackageSource, repos = NULL, type = "source")

# If all was succesfull, the following should load the transmartRClient
library("transmartRClient")
